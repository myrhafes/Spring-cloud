# Spring cloud Project

In this projet I use spring cloud to orchestrate between microservices.
The services are devlopped with spring boot
So the services are :
- AuthService : for authentification
- BillingService : service for bill
- ConfigServer : for configuration
- CustomerService : service for costumer
- EurekaDiscovry : eureka service for discovring microservices
- Gateway : the getway for communication between services
- InventoryService : service for inventory
